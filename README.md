## 2. Key Concepts & Technical Details

### 2.1. Functional Components & Hooks
- **React uses functional components** as the primary building block. They are simple JavaScript/TypeScript functions that return JSX.
- **Hooks** (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`) allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components, replacing class-based components.
- **Custom Hooks** encapsulate reusable logic, promoting DRY code and separation of concerns.

### 2.2. State Management
- **Local State**: Managed with `useState` for simple, component-level state.
- **Global State**: Managed with React Context and `useReducer` for predictable, scalable state management across the app.
- **Reducers**: Pure functions that update state based on actions, similar to Redux but built-in with React.

### 2.3. Context API
- **Context** provides a way to share values (state, functions) between components without prop drilling.
- **Provider** wraps the app (or part of it) and supplies context values.
- **Consumer** (via `useContext`) reads context values anywhere in the component tree.

### 2.4. Component Composition & Reusability
- **Components** are small, focused, and reusable. They receive data and callbacks via props.
- **Composition** means building complex UIs by combining simple components.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component does one thing well.

### 2.5. Data Fetching & Side Effects
- **Data fetching** is handled in `useEffect` hooks, often in context providers or custom hooks.
- **Async/Await** is used for clean, readable asynchronous code.
- **Loading and Error States** are managed in state and reflected in the UI for good UX.

### 2.6. Services Layer
- **API calls** and business logic are separated into the `services/` folder.
- This keeps components focused on UI and makes logic reusable and testable.

### 2.7. Styling
- **CSS Modules, global CSS, or libraries like Material UI** are used for styling.
- **Separation of concerns**: Styles are kept in their own folders/files.

### 2.8. TypeScript
- **TypeScript** provides static typing, catching errors at compile time and improving code quality.
- **Interfaces and types** are used for props, state, and API data.

### 2.9. Testing
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library** are used for unit and integration tests.
- **Test files** are colocated with components for maintainability.
- **SetupTests.ts** configures the test environment.

## 3. Best Practices
- Use functional components and hooks everywhere.
- Keep components small, focused, and reusable.
- Use context and reducers for global state, not prop drilling.
- Separate UI, logic, and data fetching.
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Write tests for all logic and UI.
- Use meaningful names and organize code by feature/folder.
- Avoid code duplication; use custom hooks and utility functions.
- Handle loading and error states gracefully.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Keep dependencies up to date and avoid unnecessary packages.

## 4. How React Works (In Depth)
- **Virtual DOM**: React creates a lightweight copy of the real DOM. When state changes, React calculates the minimal set of changes needed and updates the real DOM efficiently.
- **Reconciliation**: React uses keys and a diffing algorithm to update only what’s necessary.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows from parent to child via props, making state changes predictable.
- **Hooks Lifecycle**: `useEffect` runs after render, `useState` triggers re-renders, and custom hooks allow logic reuse.
- **Context Propagation**: Context values are efficiently propagated to consumers, avoiding unnecessary re-renders with memoization.
- **Strict Mode**: Helps find potential problems in an app by intentionally double-invoking certain lifecycle methods in development.

## 5. Folder-by-Folder Explanation
- **public/**: Static files, including the root `index.html` where React mounts.
- **src/app/**: App-level components and styles, often the main `App.tsx`.
- **src/components/**: Reusable UI components (e.g., TodoList, TodoItem, FilteredTodosExample).
- **src/context/**: Context providers for global state (e.g., TodoContext).
- **src/hooks/**: Custom hooks for reusable logic (e.g., useFilteredTodos).
- **src/reducers/**: Reducer functions for state updates.
- **src/services/**: API calls and business logic (e.g., todoService).
- **src/styles/**: Global CSS or style files.
- **src/index.tsx**: Entry point, renders the root React component.
- **src/setupTests.ts**: Test environment setup for Jest/RTL.
